# burndown

Display the current state of a repository generated from different data on the project's github page.
The idea is to provide a tool that is simple to use to get a feel for if a team or project is
making productive changes.

## Installation

Clone the repository into a valid go project path ie `git clone https://github.com/jlyon1/Burndown.git /home/jlyon1/burndown/src/burndown`
Run `go get`
Install Redis
Launch with `go run main.go`
